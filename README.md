# Loan-Prediction-III---Analytics-Vidhya
My extended analysis about the very well known Loan Prediction Problem (to to-be Data Scientists at least).

Given the dataset, we needed to find whether a person would have his loan approved or not.

Visualisation was done using matplotlib and seaborn whereas the model was trained using Sklearn's Neural Network. Achieved an accuracy of
82% on the training set.
